It is my 1st fully functionl website. After almost 3 monts of learning html and 2 monts into practice, on last week of October 2023, I have decided as my 1st fully completed project I'll make my own website. But this was not an easy task. Tough I have requred knowledge of html and css and help from chtGPT & Google, but still simultanious NEET pereparation and slow procession power of my PC make it icradable challenge to achive. 

With almot a month into this project, today 14th of November 2023 on Childrens's Day, I've been ablr to compleat this project. Today I'm incradabily happybut simultaniously very anxious too as now I have to do a lot of study for NEET, which I left for some time to do this. 

Overall it was a good learning experience, many time I feel like I should leave and only do it once I've a good computer with batter RAM. But my eternal wish of  having own website, keep me moving and today is the result of it. Today is great day. It is like a water in a huge deseart. Amoung this frustrated life of a NEET aspirant, this is a new light og hope.

Obviously This is the 1st version of my webaite. I'll do more add on to it, to make it market ready and have planned to publish it by 31st December 2023. Let's hope for the best.
